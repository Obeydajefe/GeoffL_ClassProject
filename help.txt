E.coli_Virulence_Finder.sh Usage Guide and gene accession library

E.coli_Virulence_Finder searches for virulence genes in multiple 
Enteropathogenic E.coli strains simultaneously and BLASTs for sequence identity.
However, it can easily be expanded to query any accessible gene, against any genome.

Program usable interface is as follows: ./E.coli_Virulence_Finder.sh <Accession number>

Results: Hits in the referenced genomes are listed in rows, with columns for  identifying the genome,
data on the hit alignment, and the full sequence. The gene's BLAST output, fasta sequence, and results
file are also downloaded and saved.
